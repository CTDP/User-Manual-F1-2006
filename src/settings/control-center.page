## ControlCenter

### The main menu
	
	
What can I do here?

Select the language for the CC: 	Click on the flag in the upper left corner and you 				can select one of the installed languages.

Open the manual of the Mod:	Click on the “?” icon to open the manual. It opens 				the manual in your default PDF-viewer.

Launching rFactor: 		When you click on “Launch rFactor” you will see 				more options for starting rFactor as you like it.

“Start rFactor”: 	Starts the game with the selected settings.
“+fullproc”: 	If you have more than 1 CPU core you can activate this parameter 		so rFactor uses the additional cores.
“-trace=1000”: If you have trouble with rFactor you can let it create a log file so a 		solution can be found. 
	
### Playerprofiles


What can I do here?

Here you can update your player profile with values that we think optimize your driving experience. You can also set the path to you telemetry software so that you can start it directly out of rFactor. If you want to know which values are changed you can click on “Which values will be changed?” If you don’t like the changes you can restore a backup (only if you have created one before the update).

### Cameras



What can I do here?

Everyone likes a different driving cam so you can select one here. CTDP F1 2006 comes with 3 different TV-Cockpit-Cams:

Centered Cams: Camera is in a central position.
Default Cams: Camera is a bit to the left of the central position.
Realistic Cams: Camera is like the real F1 TV-Cam on the left side of the airbox.

To install a selected camera click on “Install Set”. We suggest to try the different cams so you can find the one that best fits your preference.

### FFB-PlugIns

The RealFeel Plugin has no config-tool in its current version so you can active or deactivate it via the CC and save the optimal settings for CTDP F1 2006 in the “realfeelplugin.ini” file. 

This wizard helps you find the optimal settings for the LeoFFB plugin. As it is a guided wizard, there is no need to get into detail in this manual.

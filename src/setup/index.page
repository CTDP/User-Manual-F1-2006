## The first rollout

Or how to become a CTDP F1 2006-star?

Nothing easier than this, just follow the next lines and you should stay away from trouble on your first roll out.

First of all: You need CTDP F1 2006 for rFactor. After downloading it you have to install it into your rFactor-folder. At the end of the setup you will see the ControlCenter (short CC ) for CTDP F1 2006 where you can customize the mod like you want to have it. First you have to select your language, next step it to select and update your rFactor-Player-Profiles with values we suggest for getting optimal performance. Apart from that you don't have to update anything, all settings in the CC are optional. If you have plugins like RealFeel, LeoFFB, TV-Plugin or Spotter installed you can change the settings through the CC. After having set all options you can quit the CC so that the setup can finish.

Now start rFactor (you can start it with the CC, but you don't have to) and watch the Intro if you like. In CTDP F1 2005 you had to start with Minardi but this time you can drive every car you want at the beginning, so take that chance and select your favorite car! 

By now you should notice the upgrades for your car, you don't have to buy anything, it's already payed so just activate it when you want to have it. Each track will select the correct upgrades.

One important upgrade is the level of the traction control (TC). 100% is not fast, try a lower setting so that you can drift somehow out of corners, this should make you faster. On the other hand, if the car accelerates to slippery, try a higher value. If you drive with a keyboard, select the highest setting possible (it is also advised to turn on ABS and Steering-help for that matter).

So you guess you are ready to drive? We don't think so, you should make sure that you don't have more drivers than you can handle, so set the AI's to 21 in the rF-menu. Now choose a track and before loading it make sure that you selected all teams as possible opponents so that the AI takes the rest of the field. 
Start the event, now you are in your element, sitting in the car, ready for leaving the pit...
Make sure that the green light is on at the pit-exit and than show us what you can, show us you are the star you claim to be!
In the following sections we'd like to introduce you into the setup possibilities this mod offers. They will help you to set up your car to the optimum. Our mod is very complex and not easy to drive and to setup, so we suggest to take the time and read through it. It will pay of in your lap time!

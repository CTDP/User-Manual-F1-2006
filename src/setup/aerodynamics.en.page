h3. Aerodynamics

Front wing will be configured from 1 to 65 (in steps of 1), meanwhile the rear wing will be between 10 and 74 degrees. In actual fact, the front wing range is approximately 14-30 degrees, with 0.25 degree increments, it is unfortunate that rFactor can not display the front wing in degrees. In general, the rear wing is chosen to get enough general grip and top speed in the car, while the front wing is used to deliver good balance in the car. The wing ranges will vary at each track, but remember the default setup will be balanced, and already close to the optimum. As a rule of thumb, for every 1 click of front wing, you will need to add 1 click of rear wing to maintain balance.

It is important to point out the airstream of a car in CTDP F1 2006. Being behind (near) other car will significantly decrease the aerodynamic efficiency, while improving top speed. Following another car, it's important to adapt your driving style and racing line to keep as close as possible. Depending on the speed of the corner, it's possible to feel the aero-dynamic effects of turbulence from a car ahead when following by well over 1 second. This loss of aerodynamic efficiency will be noticeable throughout the car, but the effects are more pronounced at the front, making the car understeer and thus difficult to drive in the corners. In tracks or corners where multiple racing lines are possible, using an alternate line to the car ahead will allow you to follow them closer.
